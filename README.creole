= ConfirmationDialog =

ConfirmDialog for Vaadin is available as jar/Maven from [[https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/confirmdialog:vaadin=7|Vaadin Directory]]

Ever needed a present a confirmation dialog in a Vaadin application?

Here is a way to do it nicely. The ConfirmDialog add-on provides you with a configurable way of requesting user confirmation for a button click or some other some operation. 

Defaults like size calculation, keyboard bindings and styling are all there, but of course you can provide your own. Take a look at the demo application for sample code and use cases.

Currently only two-way (yes,no) confirmation is supported. Vote for three-way (yes,no,cancel) if you need it. And for "monolog box" use the Vaadin's own showNotification method. 

This is a server-side-only component, so no need to recompile the widgetset.

== Usage of the add-on ==

{{{

    	Button button = new Button("Basic");
    	button.setId("basic");
    	button.addClickListener(e -> {
    			// The quickest way to confirm
    			ConfirmDialog.show(getUI(), "Are you sure?", dialog -> {
    			                if (dialog.isConfirmed()) {
    			                    // Confirmed to continue
    								// DO STUFF
    			                } else {
    			                    // User did not confirm
    								// CANCEL STUFF
    			                }
    			        });    		
    	});

}}}
